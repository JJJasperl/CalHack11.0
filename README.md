# Drive-Through Voice Ordering System

This project is a proof-of-concept for using an AI voice agent to help place food orders in a drive-through store. It consists of two main components:

1. **Front-End**: A React app for the user interface.
2. **Back-End**: A Flask app that handles voice transcription, order processing, and database interaction.
